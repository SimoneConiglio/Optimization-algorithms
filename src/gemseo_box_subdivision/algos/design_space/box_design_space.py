    The returned design space gathers the variables of both levels:

      for in the sub-problem;
    - one categorical variable per subdivided variable, selecting a subdivision
      per component, which the main problem decides.

    The ``Benders`` formulation splits the two levels apart on its own, by
    keeping the categorical variables in the main problem.

    The catalogue of a subdivided variable is the range of its subdivision
    indexes, so that the default weights make two consecutive subdivisions
    neighbours in the distance used by the main problem.
