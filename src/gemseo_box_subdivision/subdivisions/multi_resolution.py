r"""A subdivision described by one categorical variable per level of refinement.

A :class:`.BoxSubdivision` spends :math:`n m` binaries to reach :math:`m`
subdivisions per component. This one spends :math:`n m L` to reach
:math:`m^L`, by choosing a box with **one categorical variable per level**
instead of one over the whole subdivision: the levels are the digits of the box
index in base :math:`m`.

    r"""A subdivision of a design space into :math:`m^L` boxes per component.

    The lower bound of a component is the sum of the fractions of the design
    space that its levels select,

    .. math::

        \ell_j(\alpha) = L_j + \Delta_j \sum_{k=1}^{L} m^{-k} \, d_k(\alpha_j),
        \qquad
        u_j(\alpha) = \ell_j(\alpha) + \Delta_j \, m^{-L},

    with :math:`\Delta_j = U_j - L_j` and :math:`d_k \in \{0, \dots, m-1\}` the
    subdivision selected at level :math:`k`, one-hot encoded.

    Two consequences make this usable where a flat subdivision is not.

    - The **resolution grows as a power while the binaries grow as a product**,
      so a resolution of :math:`1024` over five variables costs :math:`100`
      binaries instead of :math:`5120`. Since the density a budget can support is
      bounded by the binaries of the master and not by the boxes, this is what
      moves that bound.
    - The bounds stay **affine** in the one-hot variables and the width does not
      depend on them at all, so the mapping is bilinear in
      :math:`(\xi, \alpha)` exactly as the one-level mapping is, and the
      post-optimal sensitivity of the ``Benders`` formulation applies unchanged.

    The counterpart is the **model class**: the cuts of the master are linear in
    the one-hot variables, so over the digits they are additive. They can
    represent what a level contributes on its own, and not that the contribution
    of a fine digit depends on the coarse digit it sits inside.
