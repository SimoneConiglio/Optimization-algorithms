"""Sweep each mechanism of the master, separately.

The two mechanisms are not combined, see :mod:`benchmarks.configurations`, so
they are swept apart: the constant of the pure convexification on one side, the
convexity margin and the number of parallel points of the adaptive repair on the
other.

The sweep also reports the number of **distinct boxes** whose sub-problem was
solved, which is what the exploration amounts to, and which tells a run that
found the optimum quickly from a run that stopped early.

The range stops at a few hundred on purpose. The constant is of the order of the
variation of the objective over the design space, about eighty here, and beyond
that order it buys nothing: every unexplored box outranks the incumbent whatever
the cuts say. Values such as $10^4$ only make the result decay while costing the
