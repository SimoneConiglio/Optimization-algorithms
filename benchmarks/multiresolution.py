r"""One master, several levels of subdivision, and far fewer binaries.

The hierarchies of `benchmarks/hierarchy.py` put the levels in *different*
masters, one after the other, and pay for it: each node restarts a master and
discards the cuts of its parent. This puts them in the **same** master instead.

A box is chosen by one categorical variable per level rather than by one over the
whole subdivision. With $L$ levels of $m$ subdivisions each, the lower bound of a
component is the sum of the fractions of the design space its levels select,

$$
l_j(\alpha) = L_j + \Delta_j \sum_{k=1}^{L} m^{-k} \, d_k(\alpha_j),
\qquad
u_j(\alpha) = l_j(\alpha) + \Delta_j m^{-L},
$$

with $\Delta_j = U_j - L_j$ and $d_k \in \{0, \dots, m-1\}$ the subdivision chosen
at level $k$, one-hot encoded. That is the **base-$m$ representation** of the box
index: the levels are its digits.

The consequences are the point of the construction.

- The resolution is $m^L$ per component while the binaries are $n m L$, so a
  resolution of sixteen over five variables costs $40$ binaries against the $80$
  of the flat encoding, and a resolution of $1024$ costs $100$ against $5120$.
- The bounds stay **affine** in the one-hot variables and the width no longer
  depends on them at all, so the mapping $x = l(\alpha) + \xi \Delta m^{-L}$ is
  bilinear in $(\xi, \alpha)$ exactly as the one-level one, with constant
  Jacobian blocks.
- One master holds every level, so nothing is discarded and nothing is
  committed: the master may change a coarse digit and a fine one in the same
  iteration, which is the backtracking the hierarchies lacked.

The price is the **model class**. The cut model is linear in the one-hot
variables, so over the digits it is additive: it can represent what a level
contributes on its own, and not that the effect of a fine digit depends on the
coarse one. A flat encoding has one coefficient per box index and no such
restriction.
