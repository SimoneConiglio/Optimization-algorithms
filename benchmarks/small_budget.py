"""The five methods at a budget every one of them can afford.

The benchmark's budgets, 500 equivalent evaluations per variable, are far outside
the regime Bayesian optimization is built for: EGO refits a Gaussian process at
every iteration, at a cost cubic in the number of points. One run of five
hundred evaluations
takes some two and a half minutes against three seconds for the box
subdivision, and the budgets of the main comparison are two to five times
larger again, so comparing it there would measure wall time rather than method
quality.

This is the comparison at a budget every method can afford, which is also the
regime closest to the case the method targets: an objective costing minutes,
where a few hundred evaluations is the whole budget.
