"""Compare the box-subdivision outer approximation with the usual baselines.

The baselines are the methods that actually address this problem class, a
multimodal non-linear program driven by a local solver:

- **multistart** of a local solver, the reference of the class;
- **CMA-ES**, an evolution strategy, which does not use the gradient;
- **DIRECT**, a deterministic partitioning method, which does not either.

Relaxation-based global solvers such as BARON or Alpine are deliberately absent:
they require an algebraic form of the problem to build their relaxations, which
the sub-problem of an industrial case does not have.

Every method is stopped at the same budget of equivalent objective evaluations,
under both gradient-cost conventions, see :mod:`benchmarks.baselines`.
