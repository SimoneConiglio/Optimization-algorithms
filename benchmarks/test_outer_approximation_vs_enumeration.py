"""Compare the box-subdivision outer approximation with enumerating the boxes.

The baseline is the reference the method has to beat: solving the sub-problem of
every box. It is exhaustive over the boxes and embarrassingly parallel, so the
outer approximation is only worth its complexity if it reaches the same optimum
after substantially fewer sub-problems.

Both run the very same sub-problem machinery, through the same ``Benders``
formulation and the same main-problem design space, and differ only by the
driver of the main problem, so that the comparison isolates the exploration
strategy. The budget is counted in executions of the objective discipline, the
quantity that is expensive in an industrial problem.

The two ways of confining the sub-problem to its box are compared as well:

- ``"constraint"`` keeps the design variables and adds the box as a constraint,
  which is jointly convex, and needs a margin on the bounds and a scenario
  adapter to start inside the box;
- ``"normalized"`` solves for the normalized variables of the box, whose bounds
  are the unit interval whatever the box, which needs neither, but makes the
  design variables bilinear in the normalized variables and the box selection.
