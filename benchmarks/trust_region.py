r"""What the trust region of the master measures, and what it should.

The master restricts each iteration to a neighbourhood of the incumbent box with

$$
\sum_{j \,:\, \alpha'_j = \alpha_j} w_j(\alpha)
\ \ge\ \sum_j w_j(\alpha) - \texttt{max\_step},
$$

whose coefficient vector is $w \odot \alpha$, the weights of the **incumbent**.
The cost of a move is therefore the sum of the weights the incumbent holds on the
components the candidate changes, and it never reads what the candidate changes
them *to*.

For a **nominal** catalogue, a set of unordered alternatives, that is the right
thing with unit weights: the distance is then the number of components changed, a
Hamming distance, and no notion of proximity exists to express. For an **ordinal**
catalogue, which is what the index of a subdivision is, it is not a proximity at
all: leaving subdivision $0$ is free whatever the candidate moves to, and leaving
subdivision $m-1$ costs $m-1$ even to move next door.

What an ordinal catalogue calls for is the difference of the **selected values**,

$$
\left| v^\top \alpha'_j - v^\top \alpha_j \right| \le \texttt{max\_step}
\quad \text{for every component } j,
$$

which is linear in $\alpha'$ and needs two constraints per component, since
$v^\top \alpha_j$ is a constant once the incumbent is known. This module adds
them to the problem the master builds, and compares:

`indexes`
: the weights left to the catalogue values, which is what the package does today.

`unit`
: every weight at one, so proximity is ignored and the distance counts the
  components changed.

`none`
: every weight at zero, which makes the built-in constraint vacuous and removes
  the trust region altogether.

`proximity`
: the built-in constraint removed as above, and the difference of the selected
  values bounded instead, per component.

python -m benchmarks.trust_region
